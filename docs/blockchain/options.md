### Quote

> _‚ö†Ô∏è Derivatives and margin are important tools for increasing returns, but come with high risks and require strict risk management for professional traders. From 2017-2023, analyzing volatility and contract trading volume can provide insight into the crypto derivatives market._

### XBT Launch & History

> _The chart depicts the historical XBT perpetual contract on Bitmex as a reference, with OBV (On Balance Volume) used to predict asset prices based on trading volume, PVT (Price Volume Trend) used to quantify the supply and demand of a certain asset. Stand.Err representing the 200 day standard error line to measure the volatility error of prices within 200 days, and 7-day 1, 2, 3Sigma represents the price fluctuation range to analyze the probability of price fluctuation within 68-95-99.7% under the normal distribution curve_

- **2017 to 2019:** Perpetual were adopted by exchanges and surpassed spot volumes. In early 2018, there was an imbalance in PVT/OBV supply for longs over shorts, leading to deviation from the 200-day error line and 95-99.7 percentile black swan events.

- **In 2019**, there was an imbalance in PVT/OBV supply for shorts over longs, leading to multiple black swan events deviating from the 200-day error line near the beginning of the year with a 1 sigma signature exceeding the error line.

- **2020 to 2021:** a severe black swan event occurred due to the pandemic, causing a huge imbalance in perpetual PVT/OBV. Residual analysis has not been conducted yet, but it appears to have an error rate as high as 200%.

- I**n early 2021**, QE led to overheating of risk assets, but professional investors and more mature derivative tools emerged to prevent frequent deviations from error lines and black swan events. However, the balance between perpetual PVT/OBV was about to tilt. **2021 May 19th**, the China Ban occurred, causing a deviation between error lines and Sigmas, and a sharp drop in trading volume.

- **2022 to Now:** the industry faced de-leveraging due to QT, resulting in a PVT/OBV balance tilt towards short positions. Although 3Sigma and 2Sigma experienced black swan events, there were no severe deviations in the 1Sigma probability as in 2017.

### üìå Summary

In summary, volatility returns have decreased due to professional derivative trading and mature hedging tools. 1Sigma has not experienced severe deviation probability events as in 2017. Therefore, volatility returns are more evenly distributed among professional traders.
